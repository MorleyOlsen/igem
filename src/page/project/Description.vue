      <br><br><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div><h1>&nbsp;The Beginning of the Journey</h1><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div>
    <p>"The greatest joy of assembling models is imagination: starting from this model in front of us and extending our imagination to a whole new world!" Many passionate hobbyists of handmade creations often express this sentiment when asked why they enjoy assembling.</p>
    <p>During brainstorming sessions, our minds are filled with various ideas for biological manufacturing projects, such as using microorganisms to produce leather, fermenting processes to create keratin, and more.However, we always feel that something is missing in terms of novelty.</p>
    <p>One day, by chance, we happen to come across the magnetic toy we used to play with during our childhood, and it immediately triggers memories of an imaginative world created through a simple structure of sticks and balls. This moment sparks a bold idea in our minds: Synthetic biology often treats <i>E. coli</i> as a protein production machine, overlooking its true potential. Why don't we try viewing <i>E. coli</i> as building blocks and construct a truly biological material?</p>
    <p>From that moment on, we embark on a journey of pure biological manufacturing.</p>
    
    
      <br><br><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div><h1>&nbsp;Background</h1><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div>
    <p>​As a major consumer of environmental resources, the materials industry urgently needs to reduce its raw material costs while considering environmental protection. Against the backdrop of this significant societal challenge, it is essential to explore technological methods capable of fundamentally transforming the processing and assembly of materials. Hence, pure biological materials have become a focal point of research. </p>
    <p>Currently, many biological materials have been developed, such as bio-composite Mycelium Bricks<sup>[1]</sup> and Cyanobacteria-based bioconcrete <sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
    <br>

    </center>

    
    <p>However, very few have attempted to create a biomaterial using only <i>E. coli</i>, the most common chassis bacterium in synthetic biology. CAU-China's members couldn't help but let their imaginations run wild: How could one construct a material using <i>E. coli</i> ? What surprising properties might this material possess?</p>

    <p>This represents a daring challenge. In this endeavor, each cell becomes a pixel contributing to the biomaterial creation.</p>
    
      <br><br><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div><h1>&nbsp;<strong>Inspirations on our project</strong></h1><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div>
<p>      When we thought about how to build an <em>E. coli</em> material, the first thing we thought about was building blocks. Because of the long rod-like structure of bacteria, we immediately thought of the magnetic toys we played with when we were children. </p>

<p><strong>Fig. 2 Magnetic building set Brain toys</strong></p>

<p>      Children&#39;s magnetic rods are a building block toy that uses the principle of mutual adsorption of multiple 2 to 3 cm long magnetic rods and corresponding magnetic beads to create various three-dimensional shapes. Through simple splicing, the grid skeleton of buildings, ships, etc. can be assembled. It is a game that tests creativity, just like our project.</p>
<p>      In our idea, we can control the division of <em>E. coli</em> to change their shape, thus treating them as magnetic rods and steel balls, and then cross-linking them together through two interacting proteins to form this three-dimensional network structure. This kind of structure is not uncommon in construction works, such as the famous Eiffel Tower<sup>[3]</sup>, or the structure of inorganic macromolecular materials<sup>[4]</sup> in microscopic form. This also proves the feasibility of our idea.</p>

<p>So how to improve the mechanical strength of materials? Diatoms<sup>[5]</sup>, the most beautiful crafts in nature, inspired us. In our project, we tried to fill <i>E. coli</i> with crystalline silica from the outside to the inside to strengthen our material.</p>

  <br><br><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div><h1>&nbsp;Exploration on application prospects</h1><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div>
<p>After putting forward preliminary ideas, we delved into the potential applications of "My Si-lium." In a discussion with a seasoned architect, we discovered that as people's living standards improve, there is an increasing demand for enhanced acoustic environments, driving the need for active noise reduction solutions.</p>
<p>Traditional noise reduction materials, such as sound-absorbing cotton, aluminum foam, hollow bricks, and gypsum boards, exhibit certain limitations<sup>[7]</sup>:</p>

<p>1) Sound-absorbing cotton, while cost-effective with good sound insulation, lacks fire resistance, posing risks in case of a fire.</p>
<p>2) Hollow bricks, gypsum boards, and similar options are relatively easy to install but offer subpar sound insulation.</p>
<p>3) Aluminum foam, although effective, suffers from high production costs.</p>

<p>Currently, silicone aerogel is the cutting-edge sound insulation material known for its exceptional thermal and noise insulation properties. It operates on the principle of a robust skeleton structure containing tiny cavities that restrict the movement of air molecules and block sound wave propagation. This structural concept aligns with "My Si-lium"'s silica-based material and porous network.</p>

    <p><b>Fig. 5 Photographs of silica–titania aerogels<sup>[8]</sup></b></p>
</center>

<p>Silicone aerogel production demands supercritical conditions with high temperature and pressure, leading to prohibitively high costs. Additionally, the number of domestic manufacturers is limited, likely less than ten. In contrast, "My Si-lium" offers a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative, making it an ideal choice for improving existing sound-absorbing materials.</p>
<p>In addition to its primary application, we also believe that due to the excellent modifiability of synthetic biology, "My Si-lium" will become an excellent foundational biological material. With just the addition of some new pathways, we can pioneer broader application prospects. For example, developing self-repairing biological materials, filling voids in deteriorated historic building materials, creating a fire-resistant and mold-resistant protective layer for wooden decorations, and even exploring the development of catalytic interfaces and medical materials.</p>

  <br><br><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div><h1>&nbsp;Our Solution</h1><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div>
<p>With inspiration and ideas, we have design a specific plan to transform <i>E. coli</i>. Naturally, we divided the construction plan into three modules: filamentation, cross-linking, and Silicification. Through these three steps, the <i>E. coli</i> monomer was constructed into a new material with a three-dimensional network structure. </p>

    <p><b>Fig. 7 The flowchart of the experimental design:</b>① display R5 on the surface of bacteria A and B. ② express SpyCatcher in bacteria A and localize it to both poles during filamentation process. ③ display SpyTag on  the surface of bacteria B. ④  bacteria A and B mingle and crosslink with each other. ⑤ TEOS is added for the silicification process</p>
</center>

<h2>STEP 1 : Filamentation</h2>
<center>
    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4614/wiki/description/sulatonglu.png" width ="400" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <p><b>Fig. 8 Genetic circuit for filamentation (<a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4614203">BBa_K4614203</a>)</b></p>
</center>
<p>When bacteria experience stress, such as DNA damage, they may activate the <i>sulA</i> gene. The SulA protein is produced in response to this stress and has the function of inhibiting a protein called FtsZ, which is crucial for normal cell division. By inhibiting FtsZ, SulA prevents the formation of the septum, and as a result, bacterial cells cannot divide into two daughter cells as they normally would. Instead, they undergo filamentation, where they elongate and remain connected.</p>
<p>Not only to achieve a rod-like structure like a magnetic rod, but also to improve the loose and porous nature of the material to make it more in line with the expected sound-absorbing properties. We designed and expressed the <i>sulA</i> gene, elongating bacterial monomers via filamentation. In addition, the initiation of filamentation means that bacterial growth and division will be inhibited, so we designed psrfA, which is a promoter of quorum sensing system, to initiate the expression of <i>sulA</i>.</p>

<h2>STEP 2 : Cross-linking</h2>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4614/wiki/wangyinuo/spytag.png" width ="400" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4614/wiki/description/true-jiaolian.gif" width = "150" />

<center>
    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4614/wiki/description/gugugugu.png" width = "800" />
    <p><b>Fig. 9 Genetic circuit for cross-linking (<a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4614102">BBa_K4614102</a>,<a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4614117">BBa_K4614117</a>,<a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4614107">BBa_K4614107</a>,<a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4614108">BBa_K4614108</a>)</b></p>
</center>

<p>First we choose SpyTag and SpyCatcher as our cross-linked peptide. They are peptide sequences which have a specific and strong affinity for each other, meaning that they can form a stable covalent bond when they come into contact.</p>
<p>Just like a magnetic rod is only magnetic at both ends, next, we need to display the cross-linked peptide at specific sites on the surface of the bacteria through specific positioning peptides. We chose Wza, which is a component of <i>E.coli</i>'s surface channel protein and concentrates to the bacterial pole along with peptidoglycan as the bacteria grow, as the positioning peptide display SpyCatcher at both ends of the bacteria, and selected the flagellar L-Rings protein FlgH to display SpyTag. Spytag was captured by SpyCatcher, cross-linking bacterial cells into a regular 3D network structure.</p>

<h2>STEP 3 : Silicification</h2>

    <p><b>Fig. 10 Genetic circuit for Silicification (<a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4614003">BBa_K4614201003</a>)</b></p>
</center>
<p>Finally, mimicking the natural silicification process of diatoms, by surface-displaying R5 and adding TEOS, bacterial cells underwent Silicification from the outside to the inside, ensuring project safety while enhancing mechanical strength.</p>
<p>R5 is a silaffin-derived protein, which is transported by INP, a common transport protein on cell membranes encoded by LanK, to display on the outside of the cell membrane. The catalytic effect of its Lys catalytic groups on TEOS hydrolysis and silica aggregation  achieves embedding of <i>E. coli</i>
    in TEOS silicification system. INP is part of the ice nucleoprotein from <i>Pseudomonas syring</i> and considered to be the best carrier for displaying foreign proteins with large molecular weight and complex structure.

  <br><br><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div><h1>&nbsp;Summary</h1><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div>
<p>By designing the filamentation, silicification, and crosslinking processes, we have utilized <i>E.coli</i>
    to create a material with both visibility and mechanical strength. After modeling analysis, we have discovered that this material exhibits excellent sound-absorbing capabilities.</p>
