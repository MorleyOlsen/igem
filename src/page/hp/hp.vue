<p>We aim to produce a breakthrough biomaterial using <em>E. coli.</em> To understand what kind of material the world needs and what properties we need to consider when making the material, we conducted a series of human practices. We interviewed architects, veterinarians, dormitory managers, horticulturists, psychologists, and university professors to learn about their expectations for biomaterials. The opinions of people from different fields shaped our final project design and also gave us a more multidimensional understanding of the material people need.</p>
<p>In addition, we also exchanged ideas with multiple iGEM teams, and they significantly influenced the development of our project. Through this collaboration, we gained new perspectives on project design, activities, and wet lab experiments.

   <p><strong>Overview of human practice</strong></p>
</center>
    <br><br><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div><h1>What kind of materials are needed</h1><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div>
<p>In the early stage of our project, we were interested in making a material with E. coli, but we were not sure what kind of material the world needed. Therefore, we first focused on the architecture industry, which is closely related to materials. To understand the real material needs of the architecture industry, we contacted Zhang Yongzhi, a senior architect with 25 years of experience, and had an in-depth conversation with him.</p>
<h2>Zhang Yongzhi, a senior architect with 25 years of experience</h2>
<p>When Zhang learned that our project was to build E. coli like magnetic toys, he recommended us to try to produce a noise-proof building material. “As people’s living standards improve, the demand for sound environment is increasing, so there are more active noise reduction measures.” Zhang said. Zhang introduced us to the commonly used noise-proof building materials in the market, such as sound insulation cotton, foam aluminum, hollow brick, gypsum board, etc. These building materials have their own disadvantages in practical application. And the most advanced silica aerogel material, although it has excellent performance in all aspects, but the production cost and difficulty are too high, making it difficult to enter the ordinary market.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
<p>Through the communication with Zhang, we not only learned about the advantages and disadvantages of the existing noise-proof building materials, but also recognized the strengths and application prospects of our material. Environmental protection, low cost; fire prevention, mold prevention, loose and porous excellent properties, make My Si-lium have a strong potential in the field of building materials, and its current most accessible application prospect is to produce a high-performance, low-cost noise-proof material. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For our design:</strong></p>
<p>In order to further understand the research status of noise-proof materials, we compared and analyzed the properties of the existing materials on the market, and listed the competitive products. At the same time, we began to pay attention to how to improve the sound absorption performance of the material, and continued to pay attention to the sound absorption performance of the material.</p>

<p>Through the communication with Zhang, we paid more attention to the sound absorption performance and production cost of the material. For this purpose, we found two experts to understand the feasibility of our project. </p>
<h2>Professor Chang Zheng, deputy director of the Department of Applied Mechanics. Acoustics expert.</h2>
<p>Chang is mainly engaged in the research of solid wave dynamics of advanced materials and structures, and has accumulated many years of research foundation and experience in metamaterial theory and wave control methods, natural biomaterial wave dynamics and other aspects. Chang introduced us to the two different acoustic concepts of sound insulation and sound absorption and the two common sound absorption structures, and pointed out that our material can be simulated by a through-hole foam model, whose sound absorption performance is closely related to its porosity and pore size. In addition, Chang gave us some guidance and suggestions on the modeling of material properties, and recommended the modeling software COMSOL.</p>

<p><center><strong>Fig.2. We went to Chang Zheng&#39;s office for a consultation</strong></center></p>
<p>
<strong>Reflection:</strong> </p>
<p>Through the communication with Chang, we had a new understanding of the acoustic properties of the material, and the modeling team, which was at a loss, also obtained an important inspiration for simulating the downstream properties of the material. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For our design:</strong></p>
<p>First, we clarified that the target positioning of My Si-lium was sound absorption. Then, the experimental team took action immediately and simulated the properties of the material, and soon came to the conclusion that the bacterial length was not enough to support the porosity. Chang’s guidance and simulation results quickly fed back to our experimental design, making us continuously optimize the silk module to improve the average length of the bacteria.</p>
<h2>Professor Song Yuan, Fermentation expert.</h2>
<p>Professor Song Yuan introduced us to the process of fermentation industry from laboratory to factory, and gave us some ideas on how to calculate the cost, and told us not to worry too much about the cost. “The cost of fermentation will gradually come down,” Song said, “In the past, we had to fight for penicillin and spend all our money on insulin, but now they are all history with the development of technology. You don’t have to worry too much about the cost, if it is really put into use, it will definitely improve and mature gradually, and the cost will naturally come down.” In addition, Song was very concerned about the rigor of our experimental design, and communicated with us on each module of the experiment.</p>

<p><center><strong>Fig.3. We went to Song Yuan&#39;s office for a consultation</strong></center>
</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> </p>
<p>Through the communication with Song, we learned how to calculate the cost and reduced our anxiety about the cost. </p>
<p><strong>For our design:</strong></p>
<p>We were impressed by Song’s meticulous and rigorous scientific research attitude, and supplemented WB and TEM experiments according to his suggestions.</p>

<p>To ensure that our material is needed by people, we went to communicate with potential end-users to understand what kind of material the world needs. The first thing we thought of was cats, the quiet, cute friends of humans.</p>
<h2>Pet supply shop staff</h2>
<p>Pet supply shop staff We first found a pet shop staff member who was happy to accept our interview and agreed to upload the content and photos of our conversation to wiki, but said she did not want to reveal her name or show her face. She introduced us to the basic environmental requirements for pet keeping, and told us about the problem of noise stress in animals, especially kittens, which can cause some urinary tract diseases. The current coping methods include using pheromones and drugs. She thought that our idea of making a noise-reducing house for cats was not very meaningful, because cats themselves would not stay in one place and liked higher places. “It may not go to a fixed nest.” She said. She also recommended us to find Dr. Pang Mo, the animal behavior clinic doctor on duty that day, and thought that she might give us some ideas. </p>
<p><strong>Reflection &amp; For our design:</strong> </p>
<p>Through the communication with this staff member, we learned about the basic habits of cats, noise stress, consequences and coping strategies. And under her recommendation, we found Dr. Pang Mo.</p>

<p><center><strong>Fig.4. We went to pet supply shop to consult shop staff</strong></center></p>
<h2>Pang Mo, intermediate veterinarian, animal behavior clinic doctor</h2>
<p>Pang said that animals are indeed sensitive to sound, but we do not always want them to be in a completely quiet situation, they need to hear something. Creating white noise for animals with radios and other devices, and keeping the environment sound can effectively avoid the tension caused by sudden noise. Therefore, Pang thought that our material was more suitable for sensitive animal travel, such as cat bags, and noise-reducing cat bags could make cats less afraid. In addition, Pang told us that cat pheromones are divided into facial pheromones and mammary pheromones and their principles of preventing stress. “But pheromones have little effect on animals that are already stressed, they only play a preventive role.” Pang said, “Noise-proof cat bags may have some benefits.” Pang suggested that we go to talk to pet owners. In addition, Pang also said that people who keep pets do not pay much attention to animal stress, unless pets have repeatedly stressed and become ill, parents may consider taking measures. </p>
<p>
<strong>Reflection &amp; For our design:</strong></p>
<p>Through the communication with Dr. Pang, we learned that our material might have applications in sensitive animal travel such as cat bag making, and could improve the quality of travel for animals. Under her suggestion, we interviewed pet owners.</p>

<p><center><strong>Fig.5. We went to Pang Mo&#39;s office for a consultation</strong></center>
</p>
<h2>Associate Professor Zhang Yan, cat owner, mouse room manager</h2>
<p>Zhang thought that the sensitivity of cats was related to their breed and personality, and they were not sensitive to noise, but to unexpected sounds. “It was curious about the firecrackers during the New Year and lay on the windowsill to watch.” Zhang also reminded us that we need to pay attention to the breathability when designing cat bags. Zhang thought that if cats and dogs were mixed, because dogs were more noisy, cats might be more affected, so there might be better applications in pet shops and animal wards. “Pheromone therapy for noise sensitivity needs to be combined with a ‘quiet environment’ to protect small animals to the greatest extent and give them better living conditions.” Zhang said.</p>
<p>About the mouse room, Zhang thought that the facilities were already very complete. “The mouse room does not need sound insulation, the machines have no sound, mainly there is sound when operating.” Zhang thought that compared with the mouse room, the noise in the instrument room was a bigger problem. “-80 refrigerator is really noisy.” She thought that our material might have advantages in fire prevention and other aspects. </p>
<p>
<strong>Reflection &amp; For our design:</strong></p>
<p> Through the communication with Zhang, we had a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the sound environment that cats need. And we learned that our project might have potential applications in pet shops, animal wards, and instrument rooms.</p>

<p>Noise is a global problem, it affects people’s normal work and rest, sleep quality, increases psychological pressure, reduces work efficiency and learning effects. To better understand what kind of material people need in which aspects, we conducted a survey from the aspects of accommodation and psychology.</p>
<h2>Tian Xiaotao, the head manager of the male dormitory in our campus</h2>
<p>To understand the material needs in apartment living, we talked to the dormitory managers. They recommended us to interview Tian Xiaotao, the head manager of the male dormitory in our campus. Tian has been in charge of this building since it was built in 2000, and has more than 20 years of management experience. Tian has done a lot to make the students who live here have a better environment:“The toilet is a big source of noise, and it would be better if the toilet could be more soundproof. Some students are mentally exhausted because they can’t sleep at night due to the noise of water flow and washing machines. We try to make the students rest better at night by restricting the use of washing machines at night, persuading students who blow their hair after 11 pm, and soon.” In addition, Tian attaches great importance to safety issues, and always mentions safety in our communication. “Safety is no small matter,” Tian said. </p>
<p>
<strong>Reflection &amp; For our design：</strong></p>
<p>Through our conversation with Tian, we realized that if we could improve the sound insulation of the toilets, we could make life more convenient for many students who study or do experiments until late at night. We were also influenced by his work attitude of always keeping safety in mind, and further considered the safety of our materials, and added afire prevention experiment.</p>

<h2>Song Jingjing, full-time teacher at the Psychological Quality Education Center of China Agricultural University</h2>
<p>We wanted to understand the psychological problems such as mental fatigue that noise might cause and the help we might provide. Song introduced us to mental fatigue and said that people of all ages have problems such as difficulty sleeping. Song thought that mechanical sound insulation was a good auxiliary means. Song also introduced us to the need for better sound insulation in psychological counseling rooms. </p>
<p>
<strong>Reflection &amp; For our design:</strong></p>
<p>Through the communication with Song, we had a more comprehensive understanding of mental fatigue and confirmed that using our material for living sound insulation was a good auxiliary means.</p>

<br><br><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div><h1>Beyond Sound Absorption</h1><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div>
<p>In addition to sound absorption, we also communicated with a wider range of practitioners to explore the applications of our material in other aspects, such as slow release and horticultural water retention.</p>
<h2>Professor Cao Yongsong, mesoporous silica expert</h2>
<p>Cao’s research direction is to use silica carriers to slow release pesticides, and he thought that our material structure was similar to a miniature wasp nest, which might have some research value in the field of pesticides, and put pesticides in it to slow release pesticides and insecticides. But now commonly used are nano-silica carriers, and our material is larger, with a pore size of microns, and the slow release effect needs further research. In addition, Cao also introduced us to the use and storage specifications of TEOS. Reflection &amp; For our design:</p>
<p>Through the communication with Cao, we realized that if we could express specific substances in a regular structure, we might be able to produce a slow-release material with good encapsulation effect. In addition, we learned the use and storage specifications of TEOS to ensure our safety in the experiment.</p>

<p><center><strong>Fig.9. We went to Cao Yongsong&#39;s office for a consultation</strong></center></p>
<h2>Professor Tian Songqing, Suzhou Agricultural Vocational and Technical College, teaches courses on garden trees, founded the school flower art room.</h2>
<p>Tian introduced us to the different requirements of different plants for soil water retention and permeability. “Usually in horticultural cultivation, some substrates themselves have permeability, such as ceramic particles, vermiculite and so on. But these materials have relatively poor water retention and fertilizer retention. And some materials are very hard, and the ability of the substrate and root system to bind is relatively weak.” Tian also thought that our material might be used as a flower insert.</p>
<p>
<strong>Reflection &amp; For our design:</strong></p>
<p>Through the communication with Tian, we learned that there is a demand for a material that can retain fertilizer, be soft and breathable in the horticultural market. If we use our porous material to slow release fertilizer, we might be able to meet the demand for both fertilizer retention and breathability. </p>

<br><br><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div><h1>Summary</h1><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div>
<p>Looking back on our human practice journey, we learned about the expectations of our material in various fields. Our pursuit of material properties also became concrete from abstract. We use E. coli, the most common chassis bacteria in synthetic biology, to create biomaterials, which is not only cool but also useful. “My Si-lium” not only has cost-effectiveness and environmental protection, but also has characteristics such as porosity, fire resistance and anti-mold properties, which are very suitable for improving existing sound-absorbing materials. It also has great potential in applications such as material repair and decorative protection.</p>
