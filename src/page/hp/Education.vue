<br><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div><h1>Introduction</h1><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div>
<p>Renowned Chinese educator and thinker Tao Xingzhi once said: &quot;Educating people is similar to growing flowers and trees. First, one must understand the characteristics of different flowers and trees, differentiate the situations, and provide fertilization, watering, and education accordingly. This is called tailoring education to individual differences.&quot; Our team&#39;s educational philosophy is inspired by the concept of &quot;tailoring education to individual differences.&quot; In the process of designing and conducting educational activities, we pay special attention to the differences in age groups and backgrounds. We conduct targeted educational activities suitable for understanding and practical application for different groups, including &quot;enlightenment education,&quot; &quot;extended education,&quot; &quot;advanced education,&quot; &quot;special education,&quot; and one-on-one interactive education. Additionally, we have created entertaining synthetic biology card games, mini-programs, and more for children and teenagers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following is the process for conducting our educational activities:</p>

<h2>CAU-China × Beijing Bozhi School</h2>
<h3>Target</h3>
<p>Children of migrant workers in grades 3 to 4 at Bozhi School.</p>
<h3>Activity Time</h3>
<p>May 26, 2023.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>“Good sons and daughters have ambitions, and those who have aspirations strive without regrets.” Many children at Bozhi School are the offspring of migrant workers. To harness the power of youth and support the revitalization of rural education, and to spark the children&#39;s interest in life sciences, our CAU-China team aims to introduce the world of synthetic biology in the simplest and most vivid language through fun and engaging educational courses and activities.</p>
<h3>Preparation: Why did we design the class in this way?</h3>
<p>The target audience for this educational activity is rural primary school students in grades 3 to 4. Although they have more direct contact with nature in their daily lives, they do not have a clear understanding of biology and biological sciences. Therefore, our team approaches the education from an enlightening perspective, using microorganisms as an example. We allow the children to understand synthetic biology based on their intuitive understanding of microorganisms.</p>

<h3>Preparation：Why did we design the activity in this way?</h3>
<p>Our team members and the camping-mates were from the same major and the same grade, so we had a lot of common topics to discuss. However, the camping was a relatively cheerful event, so delivering a serious presentation would have seemed out of place. Therefore, during the tea break session, we used some interesting stories from our daily research training to introduce our iGEM project and share some funny moments and experiences from our lab experiments. Finally, to liven up the camping atmosphere, we brought agar plates from our own laboratory and led everyone in microbial graffiti activities.</p>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>The camping began, and together we set up tents and barbecue stoves. During the camping, we hiked together, discussing interesting stories about biology and research. We used light traps to catch moths, searching for fascinating creatures in nature. We also barbecued together, introducing our project and synthetic biology to the students while chatting.</p>

<p> <strong><center>Fig. 21 Camping Activities</center></strong></p>
 
<p>We also conducted a microbiota graffiti activity where everyone collected samples from the riverbank and river water and drew patterns on agar plates. After a period of cultivation, we noticed that the colonies on one of the agar plates were connected, forming the shape of &quot;IGEM&quot;. The students were both surprised and delighted by this discovery.</p>

<h3>Feedback: How did our activities encouraged an open dialogue with audience?</h3>
<h4>For our camping-mates: what have they learnt from the activities?</h4>
<p>The camping activity was closely related to biology. Students explored various organisms such as inchworms, mayflies, leeches, etc., and in the process of getting close to nature, they experienced the unique joy of being &quot;biology enthusiasts&quot;. Through our discussions and interactions, more students began to understand iGEM and synthetic biology. They expressed curiosity about the work our team is engaged in and gave us high recognition.</p>
<h4>For CAU-China: what did we received from this activity?</h4>
<p>This camping activity allowed us to step out of the monotonous laboratory setting and experience the wonders and beauty of nature. Additionally, interacting with our fellow students during the camping trip was inspiring.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the microbiota graffiti activity left a deep impression on us. In order to prevent densely packed colonies on the agar plate, we prepared agar with kanamycin. However, the agar plate still had a significant amount of colonies. This insight reminded us that there are many bacteria in the environment with resistance. Therefore, we need to pay more attention to the standardization of sterile operations in our future experiments.</p>

<h2>Class Meeting Exchange</h2>
<h3>Target</h3>
<p>Students in the lower grade biology class.</p>
<h3>Activity Time</h3>
<p>September 17, 2023.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>September marks the beginning of a new school term, and students one grade lower than us are about to embark on their research and study journey. During this special period, we were invited to participate in a class meeting of one grade below us to share our experiences in research competitions. Seizing this opportunity, members of CAU-China team aim to provide an in-depth introduction to our project and engage in discussions about synthetic biology with the students.</p>
<h3>Preparation：Why did we design the activity in this way?</h3>
<p>For our younger peers, who have recently started their journey in biology, they might be feeling uncertain about their future direction in biological research or have doubts about how deeply they can delve into scientific research. During this class meeting, we used our team&#39;s own experiences as an example, showcasing the ideas and interim results of our project. This allowed the students to understand synthetic biology and iGEM while encouraging them to contemplate their own interests and directions. After the meeting, we also provided our contact information, hoping to engage in one-on-one discussions with more students to further explore their interests in depth.</p>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>The presentation during this class meeting was divided into two parts. In the first part, our team leader, Zhu Wanying, and Xu Linjie introduced iGEM and synthetic biology. They used analogies such as circuits and building blocks to explain the basic principles of synthetic biology, portraying us as &quot;creators&quot; in the process of &quot;synthesizing&quot; living organisms. During the meeting, the team leaders also explained the content and procedures of the iGEM competition to attract more students to participate in iGEM in the future.</p>

<h2>One-on-one Communication with Freshmen</h2>
<h3>Target</h3>
<p>Freshman college students.</p>
<h3>Activity Time</h3>
<p>August 22, 2023.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the new semester, our school welcomed freshmen. On the orientation day, our team members volunteered to guide the freshmen around the campus. During this opportunity, we engaged in one-on-one conversations with the freshmen, introducing them to and familiarizing them with synthetic biology.</p>
<h3>Preparation：Why did we design the activity in this way?</h3>
<p>Unlike our peers in the same grade, the freshmen might not have a systematic understanding of biology and may not be aware of the frontier areas of life science. Therefore, for these students, we chose to engage in one-on-one conversations. During these interactions, we aimed to understand each student&#39;s understanding of biology and their plans for the future. Simultaneously, we expanded their horizons by introducing synthetic biology and our project, sparking enthusiasm for this field.</p>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>On August 22nd, our school&#39;s welcoming event was in full swing. Amidst the crowd, two students could be seen talking and laughing, engaging in lively conversations. These scenes portrayed our CAU-China team members interacting one-on-one with the freshmen. While touring the campus, we introduced the students to the concept of synthetic biology and how it is applied. We escorted each new student to their dormitory and gifted them postcards made by our team.</p>

<p>According to our survey, the majority of freshmen mentioned that they had never heard of synthetic biology before. After our introduction, the students were amazed and curious about this fascinating field. Such in-depth conversations also inspired students who are considering a future in synthetic biology.</p>
<h4>For CAU-China: what did we received from this activity?</h4>
<p>In this one-on-one exchange activity, we also felt the enthusiasm of everyone for biology, especially in the emerging field of synthetic biology. Our encouragement for them serves as encouragement for us as well. We will not forget our initial intentions and strive to make our project the best it can be. Only by doing so can we set an example for the freshmen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Open Laboratory Exchange Activitie</h2>
<h3>Target</h3>
<p>Undergraduate students in their first and second grade of university.</p>
<h3>Activity Time</h3>
<p>October 8, 2023.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The so-called education is by no means just theoretical teaching and paper discussions; it must be combined with practical experience. In our daily university life, many students do not understand iGEM and consider our CAU-China team to be a very &quot;mysterious&quot; group. Therefore, to allow more students to approach synthetic biology and iGEM, experience our research and work firsthand, and to let students who have just started their research in biology understand the basic technical skills in the laboratory, we organized the Open Laboratory Exchange Activitie.</p>
<h3>Preparation：Why did we design the activity in this way?</h3>
<p>During the preparation for this event, we first considered that most people might not have a deep understanding of synthetic biology. Similar to our previous class sharing activities, we prepared a presentation on synthetic biology and an introduction to our project. Additionally, we wanted everyone to have a deeper understanding of our project&#39;s design. Therefore, we chose the crosslinking module&#39;s SpyTag pathway as an example to explain the experimental process from molecular cloning to phenotype construction.</p>
<p>In the experimental session, we aimed to validate whether the construction of the SpyTag pathway vector was successful or not through basic experiments like plasmid extraction and PCR. This allowed the students to gain hands-on experience and understanding of biological research experiments.</p>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>In this event, we had the honor of inviting our team&#39;s advisor, Professor Yang Jinshui, to provide on-site guidance.</p>
<p>The session began with our team leader, Xu Linjie, introducing what synthetic biology and iGEM are, as well as our project. The students showed tremendous interest and enthusiasm, looking forward to our Jamboree journey and aspiring to participate in this exciting competition in the future.</p>

<p> <strong><center>Fig. 28 The leader of the experimental group Huang Yaohan explained the principles of the experiment</center></strong></p>
 
<p>Although the students participating in the lab activity had all passed the &quot;Lab Safety Exam,&quot; to further ensure everyone&#39;s safety, we provided disposable nitrile gloves and made sure everyone wore lab coats.</p>
<p>During the experiment, we printed and distributed the experimental procedures. Each lab station had a CAU-China team member providing guidance. Under the guidance of Huang Yaohan, the experiment proceeded smoothly, and the students successfully extracted pET-30a plasmids from <em>Escherichia coli</em> DH5α.</p>
<p>Next, our captain Xu Linjie demonstrated the method for preparing agarose gel electrophoresis gels. All the students watched carefully, learning attentively.</p>

<h3>Feedback: How did our activities encouraged an open dialogue with audience?</h3>
<h4>For the students: what have they learnt from the activities?</h4>
<p>The students gained a lot from this open laboratory experience. Some were amazed by the creativity of synthetic biology, while others felt the charm of biological experiments. Our CAU-China team&#39;s enthusiasm and efforts allowed more students to experience a sense of achievement and strengthened their determination to pursue a path in life science research.</p>

<p> <strong><center>Fig. 32 The feedback we received from our classmates on today&#39;s activity</center></strong></p>
 
<h4>For CAU-China: what did we received from this activity?</h4>
<p>This was the first time our team members acted as &quot;lab instructors&quot; and guided an experiment, and the successful event gave us a great sense of achievement. While guiding the students through the experiment, many of them were still unclear about the principles, leading to confusion and hesitation. Fortunately, they were willing to ask questions and solve problems under our guidance. This reminded us that in experiments, it&#39;s essential to think critically about the &quot;why&quot; rather than just memorizing without understanding.</p>
<p>During the waiting periods in the experiment, we engaged in deep conversations with the students. We discussed topics such as whether synthetic biology could only be applied to microorganisms. We encountered many students with a passion for biology and ambitious aspirations. We hope that in the future, we can work together to contribute significantly to the field of life sciences.</p>

<br><br><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div><h1>Special Education – Picture Book Sharing</h1><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div>
<h3>Target</h3>
<p>Children at autism centers.</p>
<h3>Activity Time</h3>
<p>Late August to late September.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>In this special education segment, we participated in the &quot;Picture Book Sharing&quot; event organized by OUC-China. We approached children with autism, used illustrated picture books to tell the story of synthetic biology and our project, and provided them with coloring books. This initiative fully embodies iGEM&#39;s inclusivity and care for the world.</p>
<h3>Preparation：Why did we design the activity in this way?</h3>
<p>The &quot;Picture Book Sharing&quot; event was initiated by the OUC-China team and co-hosted by 11 teams including ours (CAU-China), BIT-China, and HainanU-China… In this event, we create black and white picture books for children with autism, which the children then color and doodle. For our team, we aim to present the key aspects of our project (filamentation, cross-linking, and silicification) in the form of cartoon drawings and stories, allowing the children to have a more vivid understanding of our project.</p>

<h3>Feedback: How did our activities encouraged an open dialogue with audience?</h3>
<h4>For the children: what have they learnt from the activities?</h4>
<p>Children with autism often have a lower willingness to interact socially with others, and our picture book activity might be the key to unlocking their hearts. During the process of coloring and drawing, some children immersed themselves in the fascinating world of synthetic biology, while others bravely sharing happiness with everyone. We believe that this activity not only facilitated communication and interaction among the children but also added beautiful colors to their inner world.</p>
<h4>For CAU-China: what did we received from this activity?</h4>
<p>The picture book sharing activity brought us closer to a special group, making us truly realize that our project and synthetic biology can bring joy to these children and nurture their hearts. At the same time, we realized that our inclusivity and care are always needed by the world.</p>

<br><br><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div><h1>Game Development – Targeting the General Public</h1><div class="container"><div class="horizontal-line"></div></div>
<p>Educational activities are not limited to schools and students. In order to showcase the charm of biology, especially synthetic biology, to the general public, we developed two games inspired by the basic logic of synthetic biology: &quot;I Want to Do Research&quot; and &quot;Synthesize Big-gene&quot;.</p>
 
<div align="center"> <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4614/wiki/education/fig30.png" width="800"/> </div>
<p> <strong><center>Fig. 35 Game Development</center></strong></p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&quot;I Want To Do Research&quot;</h2>
<h3>Our Source of Inspiration</h3>
<p>Our inspiration for developing this game comes from a popular board game called &quot;Monopoly,&quot; which is widely known among the public. Additionally, we combined it with the molecular cloning techniques frequently used in synthetic biology, giving our game a unique and interesting context.</p>
<h3>Design concept</h3>
<p>As a game aimed at the general public, we are committed to making the rules of the game understandable in simple language. We aim to enhance interaction and competitiveness among players through the purchasing rules of various components. Additionally, we intend to increase the unpredictability and fun of the game through the design of dice rolling and &quot;Chance&quot; events.</p>
<h3>Game Introduction</h3>
<p>A, T, C, G, four players, plan to conduct a synthetic biology - molecular cloning experiment to create a &quot;recombinant organism,&quot; hoping to express different genes in different organisms. However, their research funds are limited, and only by collecting the five essential components - chassis bacteria, plasmid, promoter, gene, and restriction enzyme, while avoiding bankruptcy, and successfully entering the &quot;laboratory&quot; area can they complete the experiment (win the game)! The player who completes the experiment first wins the game.</p>
<p>For more detailed rules, please refer to the &quot;Game Manual&quot;.</p>

<h3>Game Effects</h3>
<p>After completing the board game, we first released it among children, teenagers, and university students. In our educational activities, we introduced the board game &quot;I Want to Do Research&quot; and guided everyone to play. Students brainstormed, searched for strategies, weighed pros and cons, and faced challenges on the road to &quot;research success.&quot; The small classroom transformed into a playground of knowledge and competition, where students found joy and excitement.</p>

<p> <strong><center>Fig. 36 Players engage in the game &quot;I Want to Do Research&quot;</center></strong></p>
 
<p>In addition, our board game has received unanimous praise from the middle-aged and elderly population. They have shown strong interest in the game and are amazed at our ability to design a game that aligns so well with biology and is entertaining.</p>
<h3>Our Harvest</h3>
<p>For the members of CAU-China, this entertaining card and board game about synthetic biology not only brought joy to our research lives but also became an excellent tool for sharing the fascinating stories of synthetic biology with the public.</p>
<p>The development of this game was a novel experiment for us. It inspired us to think about how to incorporate fun elements into synthetic biology, making seemingly mundane nucleotide sequences and inconspicuous bacteria come to life in everyone&#39;s minds. This endeavor has encouraged us to explore new ways to engage the public and make science more approachable and enjoyable for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&quot;Synthesize Big-gene&quot;</h2>
<h3>Our Source of Inspiration</h3>
<p>During our educational activities, despite our efforts to make the introduction of synthetic biology lively and vivid, it often remained confined to PowerPoint presentations, representing a one-sided output from us. Inspired by the idea that &quot;synthetic biology is about splicing different genes together to create new biological &#39;machines&#39;,&quot; we aimed to develop a game in the &quot;synthetic&quot; genre. This game would visually demonstrate this process, allowing the public to better understand synthetic biology while enjoying the gameplay.</p>
<h3>Design concept</h3>
<p>&quot;One gives birth to two, two gives birth to four, four gives birth to eight...&quot; Based on the exponential relationship with the number 2, we designed our game &quot;Synthesize Big-gene.&quot; The underlying logic of the game is that &quot;two identical components colliding with each other can &#39;evolve&#39; into another component,&quot; and so on. For example, two deoxyribonucleotide can synthesize cellulase gene, representing &quot;genes are composed of basic units called deoxyribonucleotide&quot;; two transcript RNAs can synthesize cellulase, representing &quot;the synthesis of proteins (enzymes) depends on the translation of RNA&quot;...</p>
<p>Furthermore, to enhance the game&#39;s fun and challenge, similar to the game &quot;Synthetic Big Watermelon,&quot; we allow players to freely manipulate the distribution of various components on the screen. This freedom enables players to explore different strategies to synthesize larger components.</p>
<h3>Game Introduction</h3>
<p>We have given the game &quot;Synthesize Big-gene&quot; a backstory: &quot;One day, a poor cellulose-degrading bacterium lost its cellulase gene due to its playful nature. As a result, it can no longer help humans digest cellulose in the intestines. Now, please help this pitiful probiotic by synthesizing cellulase and transforming it back into a powerful cellulose-degrading bacterium!&quot;</p>
<p>Players start from chemical elements and proceed to synthesize bases (A, T, C, G), deoxyribonucleotide (dNTP), cellulase genes, plasmid vectors, transcript RNA, and finally, the end product cellulase. When the components on the screen stack up beyond a certain height, the game ends, and the score is calculated.</p>

<p>Additionally, we brought this game to the Science Festival at Dandelion Middle School to share it with more people. The students were deeply fascinated by this fun game and were even reluctant to leave our booth. We took this opportunity to introduce synthetic biology to more teenagers. In the end, thanks to the overwhelming popularity of &quot;Synthesize Big-gene&quot;, our booth at the Science Festival received the &quot;Highest Popularity Index Award.&quot;</p>

<h3>Our Harvest</h3>
<p>For us, &quot;Synthesize Big-gene&quot; is undeniably a fantastic game for leisure time. However, what brings us even greater joy is the experience it provides for the public. When people around us ask, &quot;Why is the plasmid behind the gene, and why is the enzyme behind RNA?&quot; we are more than happy to explain the principles of biology and the logic of synthetic biology to everyone.</p>
<p>The enjoyment of the game goes beyond the gameplay itself; it lies in this unique experience of synthetic biology!</p>

We have also set up a quick access bar at the bottom of the official account. Through this bar, the public can easily play our mini-game "Synthesize Big-gene", or quickly find popular science articles published by CAU-China over the years.
We took over the official account platform from the previous team, and it will be passed on to all our future teams, recording the experiences of each iGEMer from CAU-China.

  Cultural and Creative Products
</h2>
<p>
  This year, we created some cultural and creative products to promote iGEM and our project to the public, and these products have been widely loved.
</p>
<h3>Recruitment Postcards and Posters</h3>
<p>
  To introduce iGEM to freshmen, we created postcards and posters. The posters included an introduction to iGEM and some of the achievements of CAU-China. During the welcome event, we showcased these posters to the freshmen in the College of Biological Sciences and distributed our postcards. These materials were well-received by freshmen, sparking significant interest in iGEM and our project. These activities not only promote synthetic biology and iGEM but also allow us to pass down the synthetic biology ideals of CAU-China from generation to generation.

<h3>Keychains</h3>
<p>We created some illustrations and produced a batch of biology-themed keychains as souvenirs for participants and supporters of our activities. The recipients really liked our designs. These gifts not only express our gratitude but also provide an excellent opportunity to promote biology to the outside world.</p>

<p>The concept of &#39;teaching according to students&#39; aptitude&#39; is also the educational philosophy of Confucius, the greatest educator in China, deeply engraved in the hearts of every educator. In our educational activities, we have always adhered to the idea of &#39;teaching according to students&#39; aptitude,&#39; designing adaptive synthetic biology popular science courses and activities for people of different ages and regions.</p>
<p>From children to teenagers, from university students to the general public, our educational activities have moved from inside the classroom to outside, gradually being accepted by hundreds and thousands of people. Our project and the principles of synthetic biology are gradually becoming integrated into people&#39;s lives.</p>
<p>We hope that through our efforts, more people can understand synthetic biology and see the vibrant development and bright future of life sciences. We hope that one day in the future, all our dreams will become a reality.</p>
